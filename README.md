This simple Python script allows users to verify whether a specific file exists on their system or You have a access to manage it from Your console. Easy way to check for low-coding PM. 
Upon execution, it prompts the user to input the path to a file — which can be of any type (e.g., .xlsx, .pdf, .doc, etc.). The script then checks if the file is present at the specified location using Python’s built-in os module.
If the file is found, it confirms with a message: "File Exist". Otherwise, it alerts the user that the file could not be located.
